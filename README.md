# TIFF-to-PDF
Converts multiple multi-page TIFF files into PDFs with Python

Run convertTIFFs.py FIRST. Change tiffPath and pdfPath to your desired directories. 

Note that when running multiple times, this program will fail if the generated direcories are existing. So, you'll need to delete those before re-running.

Suggestions/comments would be greatly appreciated! And feel free to share this anywhere you think it would be helpful.
